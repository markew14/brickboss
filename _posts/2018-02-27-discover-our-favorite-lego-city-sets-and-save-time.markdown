The Lego movie wouldn't have been the same if it didn't feature the Lego city pieces.

I think Lego City sets are a nice blend of structure and open-play. It's structured by the fact that you don't have to figure out how to build from scratch a bulldozer or police HQ.

But it's still more open to build your own stories and adventures than say a Star Wars set because there's no pre-built storylines.

Though even as a kid, I rarely stuck to the base stories. I played with GI Joe and Star Wars figures. But I never re-created anything from the cartoons/movies. I had my story-arcs. And characters. The figures were my actors.

I'm sure you will find something here to enjoy:
