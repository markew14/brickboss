Growing up I spent more time pretending I was a firefighter than a police officer.

The irony is when I come up with stories to tell with Lego, it's more often than not a police story.

Most likely because I spent 3 decades watching Law & Order. And that there hasn't been a firefighter show I liked since Emergency in the 1970s.

Though that is changing with 911. 

Anyway if you (or your kids) like to play firefighter with Lego, here are our favorite sets.

And I threw in a link to Lego fire pieces. They work well to simulate fire in Lego. If you also get the blue flames, they work well to simulate water in Lego form.
