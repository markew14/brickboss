One of the best things Lego did was to create their own lines of sets. 

The first I can remember is Bionicle.

And then around 2010 or so I remember Ninjago popping up. I would see it on Amazon. And the toy aisle.

Then one day I was hanging out in a hotel room on a business trip. And flipping around the TV. And stumbled upon the Ninjago cartoon. 

While I only ever saw a couple of episodes, I did enjoy them. They reminded me of the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle cartoons in the 1990s. And thus I could see why they were popular.

Last year there was a Ninjago movie. And of course Lego came out with sets that were inspired by the movie.

And here are 10 sets that we love from that movie.
