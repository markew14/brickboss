Here is something unique about me.

I'm not a good swimmer.

But I'm fascinated with divers.

It started after reading the book "Shadow Divers". Which is about a group of friends who find a sunk Nazi sub off the coast of New Jersey in the 1980s or 90s. 

It's crazy how dangerous it is to dive on shipwrecks and yet people do it all of the time. And I also found out about commercial divers. These are the people you need to do things like build bridges.

That gave me an idea for a story involving a commercial diver who gets mixed up in a bank robbery. With a Twilight Zone twist. 

Thus I like to build Lego diver sets. And here are some of my favorites:
