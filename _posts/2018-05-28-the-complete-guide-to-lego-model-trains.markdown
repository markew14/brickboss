My Father in Law Mr. Freddie has lived near railroads his entire life. 
He grew up in Frisco, Texas. A suburb of Dallas, that got its name from the St. Louisâ€“San Francisco Railway. His parents' house was a long walk from grain elevator used by the local farmers to ship their harvest to market.

And the house he raised my wife and her sister in is an even shorter walk. We can see the tracks from the front yard. And there's a food truck park down the street called the Railyards.

Trains are part of American culture, even if we don't ride them as frequently as Europe or Japan. 

And of course, people like to collect model trains. This article will talk about the history of generic model trains,  the evolution of the LEGO train system and present you with ideas on how to display your LEGO train sets.

<h2>The Rich History Of Trains Created By LEGO</h2>

<a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/">LEGO</a> has been around for decades, providing toys for children of all ages. Their clever and popular plastic brick toys have expanded since their humble beginnings. In the 1930s, when the company was in its early days, LEGO started to make trains. These plastic locomotives have a rich history and have withstood the test of time by being fun toys that bring joy.

The history of LEGO trains all starts with Ole Kirk Kristiansen, the inventor of LEGO toys. In 1932, he initially made wooden toys that would become the start of today's LEGO toys, and trains were some of the first of these toys to be created. Over the next 20 years, more wooden trains would be made by the company, including express trains and locomotives. These toys were made because the company wanted to toys that were easy for kids to recognize, due to being based on things commonly seen every day. The end of the 1940s was a landmark period for LEGO because around this time they began making plastic toys, even though the trains still used wood construction.

A fire in the woodworking factory of LEGO in the 1960s causes the company to stop making wooden toys, which also caused wooden trains to stop being made. The company makes a revolutionary creation in the next two years in the form of the LEGO wheel. The wheel makes it possible for LEGO pieces to move, and ushers in the birth of plastic brick trains from the company in 1964. Before this, brick trains were only used as a visual piece to foster the imagination of builders but never made into specific sets.

LEGO introduces its electric train in 1966, featured a 4.5-volt battery power supply. The trains were called blue trains because of the color given to them, and could even move along rail systems. Two years later, LEGO introduced another train creation, this time with a specialized integrated circuit. This train used the circuit to drive the train when a particular sound was heard, in this case, the noise from a distinctive whistle. One whistle blow would move the train, the next would stop it, and the third would send the train in reverse.

The following year, a 12-volt supplemental electric system was mad for trains, which could deliver power via a transformer connected to the rails.

As new lines are added to the LEGO brand over the years, a train line was created in 1980. Train rails became gray, and 28 sets were made, featuring classic and modern designs. Unique sets were encouraged by the introduction of wagons and locomotives separate from the featured sets. The line lasted until 2003 and then became incorporated into the LEGO City line in 2005. The 9-volt system replaced the 4.5, and 12 volt electric systems in 1991 and molded rails were added.

Trains for preschoolers were made under LEGO's DUPLO line in the 70s, the Creator series was introduced in the 2000s, and even custom fan creations from 3D software were introduced with Hobby Trains in 2007. Trains will always be part of LEGO's history, and the future is bright for what kinds of new ideas LEGO can create.
