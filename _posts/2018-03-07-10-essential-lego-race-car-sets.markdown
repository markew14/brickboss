Racing is my 2nd favorite sport after American football. 

You can blame my mom and by dad's brothers.

My mom grew up near Indianapolis. Thus she had me watch the Indy 500 since I was a baby. And my first biography I wrote in grade school was on A.J. Foyt.

My dad's brothers got me hooked on NASCAR. 

I was <b>very</b> close in high school to buying a modified Monte Carlo. That had 400 horses under the hood. But I knew that I was too dumb to drive that car. I'd have wrecked it for sure. 

Now I love building Lego race cars.

Here are my 10 favorite Lego sets for the car lovers out there:
