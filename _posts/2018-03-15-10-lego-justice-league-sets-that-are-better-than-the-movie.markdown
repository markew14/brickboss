Truth time.

One of the biggest fights of our marriage was over the movie "Justice League". Because the day she wanted to go to the movies, I was busy. And I only wanted to give up my work time if the movie was great.

And 2 of my trusted movie recommending friends had both said not to go to Justice League. But my wife just likes going to movies. 

I hate leaving the house for 4 hours if I think the movie is going to suck. Because while I have no trouble staying off my phone if the movie is good - if the movie is bad. I would rather have the option to hop on the phone and get some work done.

Which I can do at home. But not at the theater.

So I made a face. And well - 4 months later we're still getting over that argument.

It's silly. But that's the way marriage goes folks.

But that doesn't mean there aren't some cool sets from Lego.

So my pain can be your gain by choosing one of these great sets:
