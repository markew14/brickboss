I started building with Lego police sets because I have an idea of filming a traffic stop for a brickfilm.

While that's only a single scene. I now have become quite fond of these simple sets. They are clearly meant to be toys.

And to be candid, I find it more fun to put together something in an hour or two. As opposed to a creator city set that takes several hours. 

Which means several days (weeks sometimes) because I don't have the patience to focus like that on those sets. I want to "play" too much :).

There will be a set for any budget here:
