One of the reasons why I (Mark) got back into LEGO was because of its artistic capabilities.

I have always wanted to tell stories. I'm good at coming up with ideas. But I'm not great at description so novels have failed me. And while I'm good at certain types of painting and drawing I'm not good enough to do comic book art. Though I don't want to go too far off topic here. What I want to talk about is how to use LEGO to create art. I'm amazed at what people can do with these little plastic bricks. I love to go onto Instagram and check out the "legoart" hashtag. Because you can take in the skill used to create using just the bricks you see at the LEGO store.

Instagram is what I think of now when I hear the word art. And in particular LEGO art. There's an entire community who is dedicated to creating art out of the bricks and not limited to just what you find in the pre-assembled kits. This can range from custom builds such as this giant battleship I once saw. To amazing sculptures. And whimsical photos of minifigures exploring the world. It can make you consider about collecting them all and turning them into a LEGO museum. In the back of my mind, I vaguely remember an episode of one of those TV shows where they get their house redone while out on vacation. I think the episode featured a house where everything including a grandfather clock was done with LEGO.

The homeowner had become effectively a LEGO hoarder. She would make replacement items for everything that had been taken out. To be candid, I can relate. At my day job there's been many times where I just wanted to quit and build with LEGO. One day, I got so fed up, I just drove out for lunch and forgot where I was going. I darn near just went home. I did end up at the mall to wonder around including by the LEGO store. And for many of us phone games or scrolling on Facebook is a way to just decompress from when life gets the better of us. While I love the idea of having a LEGO filled house, there's only so much I could get away with. My wife is very forgiving. And encourages my LEGO hobby but she prefers to keep my pieces in my office. I don't recall how that episode ended. But how much of your house has finished LEGO pieces taken over your own home?

Here's the funny part of LEGO. It's a great past time. As the boxes say from 4-99. So it is meant for adults too. But you can go broke trying to buy everything. I set myself a budget. Because anything except the simplest things to build require a lot of bricks. And lets not forget the related accessories. Like tires. I read somewhere once that LEGO is the world's largest tire manufacturer. Yet, it's cool what we can create with something that most people think of as a mere child's toy. If you just want to be an art collector - you can just buy finished pieces. Start with Instagram. DM the creators. And then expand out to general web searches to find more places. You can even buy prints of LEGO photos. These are photos taken of LEGO - often funny poses of minifigures. If you buy the physical sculpture remember that the price of the item is going to be the bricks (which aren't cheap) as well as the artist's time. And there is always a value placed on the artist's name as well. Though if you are collector who likes to only own unique pieces, then I'm pretty sure most LEGO sculptures you buy will be just that. One of a kind. And as with all art it's a great investment if it brings you happiness and contentment.
