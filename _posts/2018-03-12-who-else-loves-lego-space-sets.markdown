When I first got into Lego as a 1980s kid, it was space.

My friends and I wanted to play our favorite sci-fi shows. It wasn't Star Wars though. It was a Japanese anime (cartoon) called "Star Blazers". 

Which was so popular in Japan, the way I heard it, it even beat out Star Wars.

It has an icon song. And a great story that appealed to us. 

Anyway, we loved trying to build the ships out of Lego. I can't remember if any of us had any Lego space sets.

But if you want to play with Lego space without having to use Star Wars then check out these sets.
