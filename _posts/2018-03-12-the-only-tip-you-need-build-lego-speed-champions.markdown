I believe building things are a great stress reliever. 

In particular for those who have jobs where you don't always see a direct result of your actions. I can relate to this because I've worked 20 years in software companies. 

Thus you don't always see whether you succeed or not. 

Which is one of the reasons why I got back into Lego. And frankly, why I love the simpler sets. Because in a couple of hours, I can put together a fun model. And then I take some photos.

And eventually, I hope to make some movies.

But even if that never happens, I can still enjoy the models. 

I'm also a car fan. Which is why I'm thrilled with Speed Champions series. 

And here are some of my favorites:
