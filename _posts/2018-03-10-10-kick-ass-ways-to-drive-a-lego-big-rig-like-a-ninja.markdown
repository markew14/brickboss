When I was growing up I loved the TV show BJ and the Bear. Even though it only lasted a couple of seasons.

And our neighbor for a while drove a big rig. Which as a little boy, I found awesome. Until I had a nightmare about his seats swallowing me up. And I was too scared to get back in the truck.

And I was too scared to even talk about it. So that they could calm me down.

It's been 40 years and I can still remember bits of that nightmare.

I'm not scared of those seats anymore.

And I still love big rigs.

Here are some of my favorite sets in Lego that feature semi trucks.
