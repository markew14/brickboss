You already have robots in your house.

But you don't realize they are robots.

You just call them by their function - dishwasher. Washing machine. Dryer.

But that's what they are. Simple robots.

If you want to have some real fun - then you can program your own robots. And Lego creates kits that make this real easy to do.

I can't wait to see what you build with these.
