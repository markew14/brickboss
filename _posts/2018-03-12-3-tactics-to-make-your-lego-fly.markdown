If you build Lego airplanes, helicopters or spaceships then you think of making them fly.

You cannot throw them. That won't end well. 

Instead there are different tricks you can play to give the impression that they are flying.

One way is just pick them up and hold them up. And play with them. Even as an adult.

Another option is to hang them from the ceiling using string. This is popular for traditional models. I'm over six feet tall. I don't like this because it increases the odds that I'll run into them.

Instead, what I like to do is to use clear transparent bricks. They give enough of an illusion for your model without requiring non-Lego parts to be involved. 

And here are some of our favorite Lego transparent bricks:
