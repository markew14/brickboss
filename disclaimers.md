<h2>ADVICE</h2>
<p>
Thanks for visiting! My blog is a resource guide for educational and informational purposes. (And sometimes venting about inappropriate topics such as wine smuggling and/or individuals who wear Vibram Five Fingers to dinner parties. You know--the usual.) To write my articles, I use my experiences, the experiences of others and various other resources including but not limited to the wild wild web, the Encyclopedia Britannica (what? you didn’t buy the extended library collection of 1989?) and/or The Bible. (Kidding. But maybe not.) That said, my advice doesn’t come with any guarantees. By visiting this site, you’re essentially signing a contract that says that you understand that I make no guarantees, and you won’t try to sue me or report me to the presidential administration. Because that? Would be awkward.
</p>

<h2>REMOTE CONSULTATION</h2>
<p>
Of course, this is based on me taking a quick look, sans magnifying glass, as a favor--and not the usual review and analysis of all documents and factors that I would consider when working with you as a traditional paid client. (You also miss out on my witty emails and me showering you with compliments.) That said, my advice and opinion is taken into account at your own risk, but for a proper analysis, hire a lawyer/doctor/other licensed professional--preferably one with a fancy certificate on their wall. Because who doesn’t like a fancy certificate?
</p>

<h2>AFFILIATE / SPONSORED LINKS</h2>
<p>
Guess what? If you click on a link that I’ve provided, it might be a link to someone who will give me a commission if you buy something from their site. That means that I might get paid if you click on that link. And the reason why I’m telling you this is because I want to be upfront with you, and because it’s illegal not to. (So, you know, right side of the law and all.) That said, I promise to use any affiliate commissions earned for good causes: Things like reinvesting in this business to bring you even better resources, and quite possibly at least one Sunday trip to the zoo. Because...zoos.
